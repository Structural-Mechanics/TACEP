Tool for Automatic Check of Embedded Plates (TACEP)

In the frame of Lot 3 TO4 of Framework Contract F4E-O503, ESTEYCO has developed a tool that automates the capacity check of embedded plates (EPs). This tool is released in its current version 3. for use with the EPs installed in several ITER’s buildings, including the Tokamak Complex and the Hot Cell Facility.

The tool is provided with this document in F4E IDM as a package including:
1. F4E_D_2HS7W6 v3.0 - Tool for Automatic Check of Embedded Plates (TACEP).pdf: Reference document that describes the tool itself, the calculation methods that it implements and the verification examples.
2. Setup_v3.0-beta.exe: Windows installer for the complied version of the tool.

The user of TACEP should first read and understand the reference document, check that his/her application is in accordance with the scope and assumptions made for the tool and then install the tool using the installer provided.

F4E is available at all times to support the use of TACEP but responsibility of the use of the tool, including the additional verifications that may be needed in some applications, remain in full at the user’s hands.
